* Community edition is Free and Open Source
* UCSB CMPSC56 students encouraged to install on personal Mac, Win, Linux systems

Experiences with bad code

* bad variable names
* shadowed parameters
* classes were named `Class1`, `Class2`, etc.

# Four concepts from Dillon Kearns

* Self-documenting code
    * You don't need comments to tell you what it does
    * That's because of good choices of variables names, method names, structure
    * Comments are "lies waiting to happen"
        * Your code will break if you make changes

* Microcommits
    * Not being afraid to put something into version control
